This is a blueprint for a custom app built with Langchain, Streamlit and OpenAI.

It allows users to interact with an LLM(in this case ChatGPT) through a user-friendly
front-end interface built with Streamlit. 

The app displays the chat history as all messages, including System, AI and User messages are captured in each session state to ensure
continuity in the conversation.

The app can be tailored to specific user requirements and needs.
